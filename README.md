# ReverendTranslated

You've noticed a translation problem and wish to fix it?  
Look for a file with the same name of the id of your language which can be found inside `languages.txt` in the `main` branch  
If there is none create it  
Write into it with this following format  
```
Pattern
Replacement
---
```
Every `Pattern` is a python regex pattern, every `Replacement` is the text you want to replace the pattern with  
Multiple patterns can be inserted, just make sure there is a `---` to separate them
